                               BRIEF_demo
                               ----------

This  software demonstrates  BRIEF based  keypoint matching  for planar
object detection.

COMPILATION:

Type

$ make

to  compile  the  code  and   generate  the  executable 'BRIEF_demo'.

The code depends  on OpenCV-2.1, so you should  first install and make
sure that pkg-config can locate it.  To test it, type

$ pkg-config  opencv --libs  --cflags

and you should get a list of compiler flags.

Important Notices:

1)  BRIEF_demo relies on  Hamming Distance  calculation.  Some  of new
generation  processors support SSE4.2  instructions which  includes an
instruction  called   POPCNT  which  enables   fast  Hamming  Distance
calculation.   In g++  SSE4.2 instructions  are enabled  with -msse4.2
flag. By  default, this  flag is set  in the Makefile.   Therefore, if
your instruction  set does  not support SSE4.2  instructions, although
BRIEF_demo compiles perfectly, it  will crash giving an error message.
If  you get such  an error,  please open  Makefile with  your favorite
editor and remove -msse4.2 flag.

2) For Mac OS X users:

OpenCV-2.1 release has a bug for  Mac OS X which causes serious memory
leak  when  "cvShowImage"  function  is  called. You  can  follow  the
relevant TRAC ticket from:

https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/ticket/253

Fortunately,  the  problem  has  been  resolved  in  the  current  SVN
version. Therefore, you can download the latest SVN snapshot of OpenCV
and build it  in your Mac OS  X.  In this way, you  can use BRIEF_demo
without any problem.

USAGE:

Run:

$ ./BRIEF_demo

Taking a new template image:

Show the template image to your  camera and press 't'. The screen will
be  frozen.  Using  your mouse  click the  upper-left  and lower-right
corners of the  object which you want to  detect. The application will
learn the image you show immediately and will be ready to detect it.

Enable - Disable rotation and scale invariance:

Press  'd'   for  enabling  or   disabling  the  rotation   and  scale
invariance.  Disabling rotation  and  scale invariance  mean that  the
detection will be done by only on the original template image, instead
of  trying the  incoming frame  with several  different  rotations and
scales of this template.

Quit:
Press Q.
